# CNN_New 

A basic Convolutional Neural Network made in order to recognize MNIST digits, implemented from scratch using Java.

### Model used for the CNN

MxM input image (28x28 for MNIST digits)
NxN Conv Layer with K filters
PxP Maxpool Layer
Softmax activation

### Results

70%+ average accuracy observed on training and test datasets with 10,000 iterations, 3x3 Conv Layer with 12 filters and 2x2 maxpooling, on dataset downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jidhumohan/mnist-png.
